  - **4.2.3. Session Management:**
    - User sessions must be maintained after login.
  - **4.2.4. Security:**
    - Implement basic security measures for password storage (e.g., hashing with bcrypt or Argon2).
    - Implement basic security for user sessions (e.g., using secure cookies, JWTs).

- **4.3. Layered Architecture & SOPs**

  - **4.3.1. Architecture:** Implement a layered architecture (e.g., Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access layers).
  - **4.3.2. SOPs:** In addition to the clean architecture template, define and adhere to specific Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) covering:
    - Design patterns (as appropriate beyond the core architecture).
    - Naming conventions.
    - File/folder organization (within the module structure defined by the clean architecture).
    - Coding guidelines (language-specific best practices, linting rules).
    - Test writing guidelines (specific conventions for unit and integration tests, suitable for AI-assisted development).
  - The codebase must be maintainable and extensible.

- **4.4. Analytics Dashboard (Viewable by all logged-in users)**

  - **4.4.1. Top Recognitions:**
    - Display top recognized individuals.
    - Display top recognized teams.
  - **4.4.2. Periodical Results:**
    - Provide options to filter analytics data by specific periods:
      - Weekly
      - Monthly
      - Quarterly
      - Yearly
  - **4.4.3. Trending Insights:**
    - Identify and highlight trending words appearing in kudos messages. _Assumption: This can be achieved by a simple word frequency count from messages, potentially after removing common stop-words._
    - Identify and highlight trending categories.

- **4.5. Automated Testing**

  - **4.5.1. Unit Tests:**
    - Verify individual functions and components.
  - **4.5.2. Integration Tests:**
    - Ensure different parts of the system work together correctly (e.g., API endpoint testing, interaction between business logic and data access).
  - **4.5.3. Coverage:**
    - Tests should provide reasonable coverage of main functionalities: kudos creation, retrieval, filtering, authentication, and analytics.

- **4.6. Deployment / Demo**
  - A working demo of the application must be provided.
  - Recommended deployment: Local container (Docker) or a quick cloud deployment.

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **5.1. Usability:** The application must be simple to use and intuitive.
- **5.2. User Interface (UI):** The UI should be visually appealing. (A basic high-fidelity desktop design is provided as a reference).
- **5.3. Extensibility:** The system should be designed to be easy to extend with new features in the future.
- **5.4. Maintainability:** The code structure should be clean, well-organized, and easy to maintain, adhering to the specified SOPs.

  - Each user has a profile page.
  - The profile page lists the kudos they have received.

**7. Evaluation Criteria (Summary from Hackathon Document)**

- **7.1. Feature Completion (40%):** Core functionalities (create & display kudos, basic auth, analytics) must be finished and demo-ready.
- **7.2. Layered Architecture (20%):** Cleanly separated concerns, maintainable structure, design patterns where appropriate, adherence to defined architectural guidelines.
- **7.3. Automation Testing (20%):** Quality and coverage of automated tests.
- **7.4. Standard Operating Procedures Adherence (20%):** Well-defined coding and testing standards, consistently implemented.

**8. Open Questions & Assumptions Made**

- **Assumption 1 (Kudos Entry - Team Name):** The list of "Team Names" for the static dropdown will be predefined with values such as: Infra, Data, API, UI, Analytics. This list will be configurable within the application, managed by users with Admin privileges. The mechanism for managing this list (e.g., through an admin interface) is part of the Admin functionalities.
- **Assumption 2 (Kudos Entry - Category):** Similar to Team Name, the list of "Categories" for the static dropdown will be predefined with values such as: Helping Hand, Well Done, Great Teamwork, Proud of You, Outstanding Achievement, Brilliant Idea, Amazing Support, Innovation. This list will be configurable, managed by lead and Admin privileges.
- **Assumption 3 (Authentication - Email):** For signup, any valid email address format will be accepted. No specific company domain validation (e.g., `@company.com`) is required for the hackathon version.
- **Assumption 4 (Analytics - Trending Words):** Trending words will be identified through a basic word frequency count from kudos messages, possibly with common stop-word removal. No complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) is required.
- **Clarification 1 (Kudos Wall - Search):** The Kudos Wall search will allow users to find kudos by Recipient's Name, Team Name, and Category. Sorting by recency (Recent, Oldest) will also be available.
- **Question 2 (SOPs - Specifics):** While the `generic_clean_architecture_template.md` provides a strong foundation, further specifics for other SOPs (e.g., detailed naming conventions beyond architectural roles, specific linting rules) will be determined and documented by the development team during the project.
